# Production Rollback Procedures & Contingency Plans

## üö® Emergency Response Framework

### Decision Matrix: When to Rollback

| Severity Level | Symptoms | Response Time | Action Required |
|---------------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **üî¥ CRITICAL** | Site completely down, authentication broken, data corruption | **IMMEDIATE** | Execute full rollback |
| **üü° HIGH** | Major features broken, high error rates (>10%) | **<5 minutes** | Consider rollback or hotfix |
| **üü¢ MEDIUM** | Minor features broken, error rates (1-10%) | **<15 minutes** | Monitor and prepare hotfix |
| **‚ö™ LOW** | UI issues, non-critical features affected | **<1 hour** | Monitor and schedule fix |

## üîÑ Rollback Execution Procedures

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard Rollback (Recommended)
**Fastest and most reliable method**

1. **Access Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Navigate to the www.infinite-pages.com project

2. **Execute Rollback**
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Find the last known good deployment (marked with ‚úÖ)
   - Click "‚ãØ" menu ‚Üí "Promote to Production"
   - Confirm rollback in popup

3. **Verify Rollback**
   - Check deployment status shows "Building..."
   - Wait for "Ready" status (usually 1-2 minutes)
   - Test site functionality immediately

**Expected Rollback Time: 2-3 minutes**

### Option 2: Git-based Rollback
**Use when dashboard access is unavailable**

1. **Identify Problem Commit**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10
   # Find the commit that introduced the issue
   ```

2. **Create Revert Commit**
   ```bash
   git revert <problematic-commit-hash>
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Check Vercel automatically deploys the revert
   - Monitor build logs for any issues

**Expected Rollback Time: 3-5 minutes**

### Option 3: Environment Variable Rollback
**For configuration-related issues**

1. **Access Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Identify problematic variable changes

2. **Revert Configuration**
   - Update variables to previous working values
   - Save changes

3. **Trigger Redeploy**
   - Go to Deployments ‚Üí click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
   - Wait for completion

**Expected Rollback Time: 4-6 minutes**

## üéØ Rollback Testing & Verification

### Immediate Verification Checklist (0-2 minutes)
- [ ] Site loads at https://www.infinite-pages.com
- [ ] No 500/503 errors on main pages
- [ ] Console shows no critical JavaScript errors
- [ ] Basic navigation working

### Functional Verification Checklist (2-5 minutes)
- [ ] Authentication pages load (/auth/signin, /auth/signup)
- [ ] Can attempt login (even if don't have account)
- [ ] API endpoints return proper responses
  - `curl -I https://www.infinite-pages.com/api/dashboard` ‚Üí Should return 401
  - `curl -I https://www.infinite-pages.com/api/stories` ‚Üí Should return 401
- [ ] No console errors related to missing environment variables

### Extended Verification Checklist (5-15 minutes)
- [ ] Create test account and verify registration works
- [ ] Test login with valid credentials
- [ ] Dashboard loads with user data
- [ ] Test story creation flow
- [ ] Verify payment/subscription components load without errors

## üõ°Ô∏è Rollback Safety Measures

### Pre-Rollback Checks
1. **Verify Rollback Target**
   - Confirm the target deployment was previously working
   - Check deployment timestamp to ensure it's recent enough
   - Verify no database schema changes between versions

2. **Communication Protocol**
   - Notify team of impending rollback
   - Prepare user communication if needed
   - Document the issue for post-incident review

### Post-Rollback Actions
1. **Immediate Monitoring**
   - Watch error rates for 15 minutes post-rollback
   - Monitor user reports and support tickets
   - Check database performance and connection health

2. **Incident Documentation**
   - Record rollback time and duration
   - Document root cause of the issue
   - Note any data inconsistencies discovered

## üîß Hotfix Deployment Strategy

### When to Choose Hotfix Over Rollback
- Issue affects <5% of users
- Fix is simple and well-understood
- Rollback would lose important new features
- Problem is in configuration, not code

### Hotfix Deployment Process
1. **Create Hotfix Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue-fix
   ```

2. **Implement Minimal Fix**
   - Make smallest possible change to fix issue
   - Test fix in development environment
   - Avoid scope creep - only fix the critical issue

3. **Deploy Hotfix**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "hotfix: resolve critical production issue"
   git push origin hotfix/critical-issue-fix
   ```
   - Create pull request for review
   - Merge and deploy to production

**Expected Hotfix Time: 10-20 minutes**

## üìä Monitoring During Rollback

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Error Rate**: Should drop to <1% within 5 minutes
- **Response Time**: Should normalize to <500ms within 2 minutes
- **User Sessions**: Monitor for session disruption
- **Database Connections**: Ensure stable connection pool

### Monitoring Tools
- Browser console for JavaScript errors
- Vercel deployment logs for build issues
- Supabase dashboard for database health
- User reports via support channels

### Escalation Triggers
- Rollback doesn't resolve the issue within 10 minutes
- New issues emerge after rollback
- Database corruption or data loss detected
- Unable to access deployment tools

---

## üö® Emergency Contacts & Escalation

### Internal Escalation Path
1. **Technical Lead** - First contact for technical decisions
2. **DevOps/Infrastructure** - For deployment and infrastructure issues
3. **Database Administrator** - For data-related problems
4. **Product Manager** - For user communication decisions

### External Vendor Contacts
- **Vercel Support**: For deployment platform issues
- **Supabase Support**: For database and authentication issues
- **Stripe Support**: For payment processing problems

### User Communication Templates

**For Minor Issues (5-15 minute fixes):**
> "We're experiencing a minor technical issue and are working on a fix. Service should be restored shortly."

**For Major Rollbacks (requiring rollback):**
> "We've identified a technical issue and have rolled back to a stable version. All user data is safe and the service is now restored. We're investigating the cause and will deploy a fix soon."

**For Extended Outages (>30 minutes):**
> "We're experiencing technical difficulties and our team is working urgently to restore service. We'll provide updates every 15 minutes until resolved. All user data remains secure."

   - Enhance monitoring and alerting
   - Review deployment process for gaps

2. **Team Retrospective**
   - Conduct post-incident review
   - Identify lessons learned
   - Update rollback procedures if needed

## ‚úÖ Rollback Procedure Testing

### Monthly Rollback Drills
1. **Simulate Production Issue**
   - Deploy intentional non-critical issue to test environment
   - Practice rollback procedure with full team

2. **Time and Document**
   - Measure rollback execution time
   - Document any procedural issues
   - Update procedures based on learnings
