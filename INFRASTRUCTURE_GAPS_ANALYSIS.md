- **Application metrics**: No business metric tracking beyond basic error reports
- **User experience monitoring**: No RUM (Real User Monitoring) implementation
- **Distributed tracing**: No request flow visibility across services

**Technical Impact**:
```typescript

  await storeError(errorReport, supabase)
  // Missing: Performance correlation, user journey tracking
}
```

**Required Infrastructure**:
- APM platform integration (Sentry/DataDog)
