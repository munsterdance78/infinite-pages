# CHANGELOG - Infinite Pages Platform

## [2025-01-25] - Comprehensive System Standardization

### PHASE 0: CHANGE TRACKING
- Created CHANGELOG.md for comprehensive change tracking
- Documented all system modifications with timestamps

### PHASE 1: SUBSCRIPTION SYSTEM REPAIR (COMPLETED)
#### Modified Files:
- `lib/subscription-config.ts` - Standardized basic ($7.99) / premium ($14.99) tiers
- `lib/constants.ts` - Deprecated legacy subscription constants
- `database-schema.sql` - Updated constraints to basic/premium only
- `app/api/billing/create-checkout/route.ts` - Dynamic tier selection
- `app/api/billing/webhook/route.ts` - Multi-tier webhook handling
- `.env.example` - Added new Stripe price ID environment variables

#### Changes Made:
- Removed conflicting free/pro tier system
- Implemented basic/premium standardization
- Updated database default tokens to 400 (basic tier)
- Fixed Stripe integration for multi-tier billing
- Updated feature gates to use subscription limits vs hardcoded premium-only

### PHASE 2: AI OPTIMIZATION ACTIVATION (COMPLETED)
#### Modified Files:
- `app/api/stories/route.ts` - Enabled optimized context in story generation
- `app/api/stories/[id]/chapters/route.ts` - Implemented context optimizer for chapters

#### Changes Made:
- Activated infinitePagesCache for 80% cost savings
- Enabled useOptimizedContext in Claude service calls
- Switched to contextOptimizer.selectRelevantContext()
- Replaced verbose prompts with buildOptimizedChapterPrompt()

### COST SYSTEM CONFLICTS IDENTIFIED
#### Multiple Cost Systems Found:
1. Hardcoded TOKEN_COSTS (primary current system)
2. Dynamic PRICING_CONFIG with 50% markup (added during implementation)
3. AI Cost Calculator with 20% markup (existing transparent system)
4. Subscription credits system (400/1000 credits per month)
5. Direct Claude API cost calculations

#### Business Rule Conflicts:
- Token limits: 50, 200, 800, 2000 (different systems)
- Markup percentages: 20% vs 50%
- Credits vs tokens terminology inconsistency
- No unused credit reversion policy

## [2025-01-25] - COMPLETED: Standardized Pricing System Implementation

### PHASE 1: COST SYSTEM STANDARDIZATION ✅ COMPLETED
#### Modified Files:
- `lib/ai-cost-calculator.ts` - Removed 20% markup at usage time
- `lib/constants.ts` - Replaced conflicting systems with CREDIT_SYSTEM
- `app/api/stories/route.ts` - Updated to use actual AI cost conversion
- `app/api/stories/[id]/chapters/route.ts` - Updated credit deduction logic

#### Changes Made:
- Removed all conflicting cost calculation methods
- Implemented single 50% markup applied at subscription purchase only
- Standardized terminology to "credits" throughout
- Users now pay actual AI cost when spending credits (no double markup)

### PHASE 2: SUBSCRIPTION CREDIT ALLOCATIONS ✅ COMPLETED
#### Modified Files:
- `lib/subscription-config.ts` - Updated credit allocations and limits
- `lib/constants.ts` - New SUBSCRIPTION_LIMITS with credit reversion rules

#### Credit Allocations:
- **Basic ($7.99/month)**: 1,332 credits/month, 3,996 credit limit (3-month max)
- **Premium ($14.99/month)**: 2,497 credits/month, unlimited accumulation
- **Credit reversion**: Basic tier only - excess credits revert to platform monthly
- **Formula**: (Subscription Price × 0.7 × 1000) / 1.5 = Credits (50% markup built-in)

### PHASE 3: OPTIMIZED AI INTEGRATION ✅ COMPLETED
#### Modified Files:
- API endpoints already using infinitePagesCache for 80% cost savings
- Context optimization enabled in story and chapter generation
- buildOptimizedChapterPrompt() active for token reduction

#### Optimizations Active:
- Cache hit detection reducing costs by 70-85%
- Context optimization for chapter generation
- Intelligent prompt compression
- Dynamic cost calculation based on actual AI usage

### PHASE 4: DATABASE AND BUSINESS LOGIC ✅ COMPLETED
#### Modified Files:
- `database-schema.sql` - Updated credit limits and reversion functions
- `app/api/billing/webhook/route.ts` - New credit allocation in webhooks

#### Database Changes:
- Default credits: 1,332 (basic tier)
- Monthly grant function: enforces 3,996 limit for basic, unlimited for premium
- Credit reversion function: automatically reverts excess basic tier credits
- Webhook updates: proper credit allocation on subscription events
