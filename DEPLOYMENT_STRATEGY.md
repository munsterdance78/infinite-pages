## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Vercel Environment Variables Configuration

**Required Variables for Production:**
```
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ukadivsgkwfjwzbutquu.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[FROM_ENV_LOCAL]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[FROM_ENV_LOCAL]

# AI Service
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=[FROM_ENV_LOCAL]

# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[FROM_ENV_LOCAL]
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=[FROM_ENV_LOCAL]
STRIPE_CONNECT_CLIENT_ID=[FROM_ENV_LOCAL]
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=[FROM_ENV_LOCAL]

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.infinite-pages.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.infinite-pages.com
```

### Step 2: Deployment Process

1. **Pre-deployment Verification**
   - Confirm all environment variables set in Vercel dashboard
   - Verify target domain points to correct Vercel project
   - Ensure production database has latest schema and RLS policies

2. **Deployment Execution**
   - Deploy via git push to main branch OR
   - Trigger manual deployment in Vercel dashboard
   - Monitor build logs for any issues

3. **Post-deployment Verification**
   - Visit https://www.infinite-pages.com
   - Test authentication flow (sign up/sign in)
   - Verify dashboard loads without errors
   - Test story creation functionality
   - Check browser console for any client-side errors

### Step 3: Production Health Check

**Immediate Checks (0-5 minutes):**
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] Authentication pages accessible
- [ ] No console errors related to missing environment variables
- [ ] API endpoints return proper responses (401 for unauthorized access)

**Functional Checks (5-15 minutes):**
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] User login works
- [ ] Dashboard loads with user data
- [ ] Story creation workflow functional
- [ ] No database permission errors

---

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Site returns 500 errors for main pages
- Authentication completely broken
- Database connection failures
- Critical API endpoints non-functional

### Manual Rollback Process
1. **Via Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click "Promote to Production" on last known good deployment
   - Monitor rollback completion

2. **Via Git:**
   - Revert problematic commit: `git revert <commit-hash>`
   - Push to main branch to trigger new deployment

### Rollback Verification
- [ ] Site loads correctly
- [ ] Authentication functional
- [ ] Database access restored
- [ ] All critical features working

---

## 📊 Monitoring and Alerts

### Production Monitoring Setup
- **Error Tracking**: Console errors and API failures
- **Performance**: Page load times and API response times
- **User Experience**: Authentication success rates
- **Security**: Rate limit violations and threat detection

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Authentication success rate (target: >95%)
- Dashboard load time (target: <3 seconds)
- Story creation success rate (target: >90%)
- API error rate (target: <1%)

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Production Security Checklist
- [x] All environment variables stored securely in Vercel
- [x] Security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [x] Rate limiting active on all API routes
- [x] Authentication required for protected endpoints
- [x] Content Security Policy restricts external resources
- [x] CORS configured for production domain only

### Security Monitoring
- Security threat detection active in middleware
- Rate limit violations logged
- Suspicious activity monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts tracked

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: "supabaseKey is required" errors
**Solution**: Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is set in Vercel environment variables

**Issue**: Authentication not working
**Solution**: Check SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY and ensure RLS policies are applied

**Issue**: Story creation fails
**Solution**: Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set and valid

**Issue**: Payment features not working
**Solution**: Check all STRIPE_* environment variables are configured

### Debug Steps
1. Check Vercel deployment logs for build errors
2. Check browser console for client-side errors
3. Verify environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Test API endpoints directly
5. Check Supabase logs for database issues
